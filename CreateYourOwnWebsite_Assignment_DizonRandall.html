        <h1>Welcome to the musical side of things!</h1>
        <p>
            I'm going to teach you the quickest way to know what key a song is in just by
            looking at a musical staff!
        </p>
        <img src="Media/Pictures/Staffs.jpg" alt="Musical Staff with two flats">
        <p>
            First, take a look at the staff and see how many sharps (#) or flats (b) there are.
        </p>
        <img src="Media/Pictures/circle_of_fifths_colors_2flats.png" alt="Circle of fifths with two flats">
        <p>
            Next, pull up an image of the "<em class="shadow">Circle of Fifths</em>" on Google images. As you can see here, a song with 2 flats is either in the key of Bb Major or G Minor.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, the final thing to do is listen to the song and determine whether it sounds "happy" (major) or "sad" (minor).
        </p>
        <p>
            An example of a song in Gm is Ballad of the Catboi (provided below). Please give it a listen!
        </p>
