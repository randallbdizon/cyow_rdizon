----- Module Assignment 6 -----
Add the following features to your website::
- Either a horizontal or vertical navigation menu
- At least 3 HTML pages that you can navigate between using the navigation menu
- - Hint: this means there should be a navigation menu on each page!
- - My expectation is that your navigation menu will be consistent across all pages of your website, since this is commonplace on websites today
- - You're welcome to have some navigation links that don't function yet, for web pages you plan to develop in the future
- One page of your website should use a 2- or 3-column layout (see Ch 6)
- - Have writer's block? Consider asking ChatGPT to write you the text for an article about a topic related to your website.
- One link that opens a different website in a different browser tab or browser window (see pg. 228)
- One link that links to a placeholder on the same page (see pg. 230)
- Don't forget to put a few comments in both your HTML and CSS code that explain the purpose of the code

Note: you don't have to keep anything in your website that were requirements from previous iterations of the "Create Your Own Website" assignment.
For example, you don't have to keep any CSS styles that you coded for the previous assignment.
They are not part of your grade anymore, so you can make any changes to the CSS you need to for this iteration of your website.
Feel free to change any aspects of your project to meet the requirements for this particular assignment.

            I'm going to teach you the quickest way to know what key a song is in just by
            looking at a musical staff!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            First, take a look at the staff and see how many sharps (#) or flats (b) there are.
        </p>
        <img src="Media/Pictures/Staffs.jpg" alt="Musical Staff with two flats">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Next, pull up an image of the "<em class="shadow">Circle of Fifths</em>" on Google images
        </p>
        <p>As you can see here, a song with 2 flats is either in the key of Bb Major or G Minor.
        </p>
        <p class="sidenote">
            (Note: Any Capitalized letter is usually assumed to be in the major key unless it's followed by a lowercase
            "m".)
        </p>
        <p class="sidenote">
            (In the case above, Bb = B-flat major and Gm = G minor.)
        </p>
        <img src="Media/Pictures/circle_of_fifths_colors_2flats.png" alt="Circle of fifths with two flats">
        <br>
        <p>
            Then, the final thing to do is listen to the song and determine whether it sounds "happy" (major) or "sad"
            (minor).
        </p>
        <p>
            An example of a song in Gm is Ballad of the Catboi (provided in the Midi Files section). Please give it a listen!
